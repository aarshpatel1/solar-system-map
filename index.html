                The Solar System is the gravitationally bound planetary system of the Sun and the objects that orbit
                it,
                either directly or indirectly. Of the objects that orbit the Sun directly, the largest are the eight
                planets, with the remainder being smaller objects, such as the five dwarf planets and small Solar
                System
                bodies. Of the objects that orbit the Sun indirectly�the moons�two are larger than the smallest
                planet,
                Mercury.
                The Solar System formed 4.6 billion years ago from the gravitational collapse of a giant
                interstellar
                molecular cloud. The vast majority of the system's mass is in the Sun, with the majority of the
                remaining
                mass contained in Jupiter. The four smaller inner planets, Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars, are
                terrestrial
                planets, being primarily composed of rock and metal. The four outer planets are giant planets, being
                substantially more massive than the terrestrials. The two largest, Jupiter and Saturn are gas
                giants, being
                composed mainly of hydrogen and helium; the two outermost planets, Uranus and Neptune, are ice
                giants, being
                composed mostly of substances with relatively high melting points compared with hydrogen and helium,
                called
                volatiles, such as water, ammonia and methane. All eight planets have almost circular orbits that
                lie within
                a nearly flat disc called the ecliptic.
                The Solar System also contains smaller objects. The asteroid belt, which lies between the orbits of
                Mars and
                Jupiter, mostly contains objects composed, like the terrestrial planets, of rock and metal. Beyond
                Neptune's
                orbit lie the Kuiper belt and scattered disc, which are populations of trans-Neptunian objects
                composed
                mostly of ices and beyond them a newly discovered population of sednoids. Within these populations
                are
                several dozen to possibly tens of thousands of objects large enough that they have been rounded by
                their own
                gravity. Such objects are categorized as dwarf planets. Identified dwarf planets include the
                asteroid Ceres
                and the trans-Neptunian objects Pluto and Eris. In addition to these two regions, various other
                small-body
                populations, including comets, centaurs and interplanetary dust clouds, freely travel between
                regions. Six
                of the planets, at least four of the dwarf planets, and many of the smaller bodies are orbited by
                natural
                satellites, usually termed "moons" after the Moon. Each of the outer planets is encircled by
                planetary rings
                of dust and other small objects.
                The solar wind, a stream of charged particles flowing outwards from the Sun, creates a bubble-like
                region in
                the interstellar medium known as the heliosphere. The heliopause is the point at which pressure from
                the
                solar wind is equal to the opposing pressure of the interstellar medium; it extends out to the edge
                of the
                scattered disc. The Oost cloud, which is thought to be the source for long-period comets, may also
                exist at
                a distance roughly a thousand times further than the heliosphere. The Solar System is located in the
                Orion
                Arm, 26,000 light-years from the center of the Milky Way galaxy.
